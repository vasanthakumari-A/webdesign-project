</br>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
</br></br>What are the system requirements for running TNG?
<cluded?
</br>Yes. All PHP scripts are merely text files, so the code is easily accessible. You may make any changes you'd like, but I may not be able to support you from there. Be sure to keep good documentation!
</br>How does data get into TNG? Do I need a GEDCOM file?
</br>If you already have your genealogy in a desktop program (like RootsMagic, Legacy, FamilyTreeMaker, Reunion, PAF, etc.), then the quickest and easiest way to get your data into TNG is to have your program output a GEDCOM file (standard method of genealogical data exchange) and then import it into TNG. The whole process takes only a few minutes (or less, depending on how big your file is). Of course you don't really need a GEDCOM file. If you want to enter your data by hand directly into TNG, you can do that through the administrative interface.
</br>What does LDS mean?
</br>LDS refers to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (aka, "Mormons"). The LDS church invented the GEDCOM standard, so there are several LDS-specific tags. TNG supports these tags, but these fields will not be displayed if you don't use them. If you don't even want to see them in the data entry screens, you may turn that off as well.
</br>How many names can TNG support?
</br>Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of names it can support. I have 14,000 names in my database and have never had a performance issue. Some have many more (I know of one user with about 1,250,000 names). If your database is that huge, however (a few hundred thousand names or more), you may begin to notice a slight performance drain (pages will take a few seconds longer to display). The vast majority of people will not experience any problems, since most files consist of 10,000 names or less.
</br>Can TNG be my only genealogy program?
</br>It certainly can. There are definitely still reasons to use a desktop solution as your primary repository (simply because you don't need to be connected to the Internet to use it, and also because those programs usually contain many features that a web-based application can't), but if you're looking to collaborate with remote users, or if you do most of your work away from home, using TNG as your only program is a valid option.
</br>Can TNG work as a "module" in WordPress?
</br>Yes, a free add-on has been written for allow you to run TNG from within WordPress. A link to this add-on will be shown to you when you purchase TNG.
</br>Do you have a support forum?
</br>Yes, there is a support forum, a wiki, a blog and two mailing lists.
</br>Can TNG be used with any other databases?
</br>No, it can only be used with MySQL.
</br>Can I use TNG on more than one website?
</br>You can, but it would require you to buy an additional license. TNG may be used on one web site only, although you may also install it on your home computer, provided your home computer is not also your Internet web server. :)
</br>I am a web hosting provider. Can I resell TNG?
</br>Not without permission, but if you would like to do this I would be happy to set up an arrangement with you.
</br>Can I charge people to use TNG on my site?
</br>You may, as long as we're talking about one installation and you are the chief administrator. If you are installing TNG multiple times so that each user can have their own independent environment, you will need additional licenses.
</br></br>Can TNG be used to put my genealogy on a CD? Can it make a book?
Since TNG requires PHP, MySQL and a web server, it will not work on a CD. Besides, making a static CD defies the whole premise of TNG, which is to make your genealogy dynamic. As for making books, TNG does not have a specific "Create Book" function, but you may certainly print off your web pages and form them into a book. I know of people who have done that. You could also export your information to a GEDCOM file and then import that into a program that does create books.
</br>I already have another application using my MySQL database. Do I need another database to use TNG?
</br>No, you should only need one database. Each database can contain many tables, and TNG's tables are defaulted to have a "tng_" prefix to keep them separate from any other tables you may already have. On top of that, you can still change the name of any TNG table just in case you're still having a collision problem.
